# Subscript-Defaults
This repo is from a talk I gave at the Orlando iOS Devs meetup in February '18. It shows how you can use Generic Subscripting the make UserDefaults type safe.

## To Do
1. Expand the UserDefaults subscript to handle complex objects that require a dictionary to represent them. 
2. Expand the UserDefaults subscript to support optional values.
